                    Sleep is a complex active process that all living organisms need. It is an interplay of biological and behavioural processes that are essential for normal
                    bodily functioning. We are all learning more about sleep every day but there are some important points to consider:

                        Sleep has different stages that are important for these different functions. Most of our sleep is relatively ‘light’, some is ‘deeper’ and there is a type
                        of sleep that is similar to a wake-like state where we have most of our dreams. We move through these different stages regularly throughout the night often
                        in 90-minute cycles.

                    Sleep is a natural need, associated with many vital functions, including rest for the brain and the body. During the day there is a build-up of substances in
                    the body, known as metabolic waste, which is cleared during sleep.

                    Think about how aching and tired muscles and a worn-out brain from working overtime at work both feel suddenly better when you wake up from a good sleep. Other
                    important functions are optimised with good sleeping habits including emotional regulation, consolidation of learning and memories, and hormone regulation.

                    There is no magic number when it comes to the perfect amount of sleep. Generally, most adults will need sleep for anywhere between 6.5-8.5 hours but this
                    differs amongst everyone. There are also multiple factors that can temporarily influence the length of sleep including pain, menopausal symptoms, bladder
                    issues, life changes and life stressors (money, bereavement, health issues etc.).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ideal amount of sleep changes across the lifetime. Older adults, for example, normally have reduced amounts of deep sleep and wake more frequently while
                    newborn babies will sleep for 14-18 hours, though not all at once.

                        We cycle through different stages of sleep approximately every 90 minutes. These cycles are made up of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, where our brain
                        is resting, and the body is active and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) when we have most of our dreams.

                      <h3>We spend most of our time in light sleep (45-55%) where we can move and are easily woken.</h3>
                      <p>
                        We can also have very light sleep, between awakenings, for 5% of the night. We only spend 20% of the night in deep sleep (NREM) and during this period,
                        growth hormones are secreted.
                      </p>

                    As mentioned before, it is believed that most of our dreaming occurs during this type of sleep, whether we remember them or not! We spend 75% of the night in
                    NREM sleep, especially earlier in the night and the remaining 25% in REM sleep.

                    We are familiar with the feeling of needing sleep, or times when we don’t feel particularly tired either. To enable sleep, we need to build up a ‘sleep debt’
                    which occurs after being awake for at least 8 hours and is the trigger for sleep. This needs to be at the right time of day, which relates to our circadian
                    rhythms. Simply put, individuals need to sleep at night and be awake and alert during the day.

                        Darkness is a natural trigger for sleep in humans. Once there is a lack of natural light, our body releases Melatonin, the “sleep” hormone which has an
                        hypnotic effect on the body and drops the body temperature.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the morning, light messages supress the release of melatonin and reverses this hypnotic effect, increases body temperature rendering us more “alert”.

                    By definition, insomnia means “difficulty initiating (getting to sleep) or maintaining sleep (staying asleep)” and usually requires these sleep problems to be
                    disruptive for at least 3 out of 7 nights per week and be persistent for six months or more. Individuals with insomnia report a racing mind, tossing and turning
                    as well as physical tension whilst in bed. Recent research supports how many individuals with insomnia have overactive brains during sleep and the brain is in a
                    wake-like state contributing to poor sleep quality which is a central feature of insomnia. Many individuals wake up feeling unrefreshed in the morning and are
                    tired during the day – being “wired & tired”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experiencing difficulties getting to sleep or staying asleep at some point is also normal. However, when this occurs every night, it is a symptom of insomnia
                    and can negatively impacting on day-to-day life.

                    Insomnia is complex and different for each person. There can be obvious reasons as to why insomnia started such as medical conditions that affect sleep but
                    there are often other factors that maintain the poor cycle. Some people may be more likely to have insomnia based on predisposing factors like their family
                    history and the environmental factors.

                        More often, insomnia stems from a sleep disruption followed by the development of poor sleep habits as a compensatory adaptation. Life changes and
                        stressors, relationship/family issues, discomfort and illness including pain, depression and anxiety, shiftwork, diet, bedroom factors and sleeping pills
                        are just some of the precipitating factors that can throw a normal sleeping routine out of whack.
