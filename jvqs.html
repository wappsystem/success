                    It is very hard to quickly transition a highly active brain into a relaxed state. Correspondingly, when the bedroom is used for activities other than sleep and
                    intimacy (such as, watching television, electronic devices or reading for long periods) it is often difficult to fall straight to sleep after these activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Research indicates that when these stimulating activities are separated from the bedroom environment, the brain learns to associate the bedroom with a relaxed
                    state, making it easier to fall asleep.

                    The bedroom environment is important. People tend to find their sleep is more restless and wakeful when they are uncomfortable. While there are some aspects
                    that can’t always be easily controlled (such as traffic noise), temperature is one that can be easily managed. Research shows that a cool and dark room with
                    enough blankets to stay warm is an ideal sleeping environment.

                        When people have a consistent sleeping routine, they often wake up naturally at the same time every day without the need for an alarm clock! This is because
                        their body clock is set to these times.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In cases of insomnia, this pattern is inconsistent, often resulting in feelings of tiredness and exhaustion and the wrong times (such as in the middle of
                        the day). Often, this can be managed by setting up consistent bed and wake up times, despite the previous nights sleep pattern.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Waking up throughout the night is also normal.</h3>
                      <p>
                        Even healthy sleepers wake multiple times and often fall back to sleep very quickly. Trouble falling back to sleep during the night is often due to being in
                        a hyperaroused state, possibly caused by anxiety around sleep.

                    It can be hard to gauge when a good time for sleep is, especially if you’re having trouble keeping a consistent sleeping pattern. The brain and body need to be
                    tired to sleep. Signs of tiredness are different for everyone but often can appear as difficulty concentrating, heavy eyelids and finding it hard to think about
                    anything other than going to bed.

                    Sleep studies show that most individuals will return to sleep within about 15 minutes after waking during the night. However, these wakeful periods can be a lot
                    longer for those with insomnia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sleep professionals suggest managing this by having consistent routine, a comfortable sleeping environment and perhaps getting out of bed and doing something
                    else until the yearning for sleep returns.

                    If your sleep is considerably shortened, it can be very noticeable the following day in terms of attention, concentration and mood. Interestingly, sleep studies
                    show that the brain is very efficient at managing the sleep type it requires.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, if deep sleep was restricted the night before, the brain will obtain more deep sleep in the subsequent night to compensate. This is why keeping a
                    consistent sleep pattern is key and why going to bed earlier after a late night is not necessarily better.

                    depression can often increase the risk of insomnia and poor sleep quality. In the same way chronic pain can also trigger poor sleep quality but poor sleep
                    patterns can also predict increased pain sensitivity. Sleep health experts believe that the most effective method of treating symptoms of poor sleep is ensuring
                    all aspects of an individual’s health, not only sleep, are being addressed and vice versa.

                    This is a common myth. Evidence clearly shows that over the last 100 years, the hours of sleep each night has remained relatively stable. However, research has
                    established, that sleep quality has been affected when individuals choose to use smartphones or be readily available 24 hours a day.

                    reduced sleep ( <6 hours) are at increased risk of other health related issues.

                    ufficient sleep enables individuals to feel more refreshed in the morning and this is unique to each person. However, the timing of sleep is equally important
                    along with a constant waking time and natural morning sunlight which regulates the sleep-wake cycle and sets important boundaries around healthy sleep habits.
