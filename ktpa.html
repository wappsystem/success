                      <p>
                        The body clock controls the cycle of sleep and wakefulness across 24 hours. This pattern is regulated by exposure to light and dark. Exposure to the dark
                        triggers the release of melatonin (the body’s sleep hormone) which promotes sleep.

                    Light is the most important external signal for our body clock. A reduction in light at night triggers the brain to release melatonin, helping with sleep onset.
                    When an eye detects light, especially natural sunlight in the morning, signals are sent to the brain to suppresses melatonin secretion, helping people feel more
                    alert.
                  </p>
                  <p>In the same way, artificial light from electronic devices like mobile phones can also supress melatonin secretion and delay sleep at night-time.</p>

                    The time and amount of food consumed influences sleep, especially if consumed just before bedtime. Research shows that sleep-deprived individuals prefer sweet
                    and fatty foods compared to when they are sleeping better. Individuals who are sleep deprived often make poor food choices that can lead to weight gain but can
                    also negatively affect sleep. This is related to appetite hormones (leptin and ghrelin) which tells the brain if you are hungry or satisfied.

                    (45-55%) as we arouse to move, check our environment, and maintain safety. This is thought to be an evolutionary biological necessity.
